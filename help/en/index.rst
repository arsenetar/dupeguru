dupeGuru is a tool to find duplicate files on your computer. It has three
modes, Standard, Music and Picture, with each mode having its own scan types
and little features.

Although dupeGuru can easily be used without documentation, reading this file
will help you to master it. If you are looking for guidance for your first
duplicate scan, you can take a look at the :doc:`Quick Start <quick_start>`
section.

It is a good idea to keep dupeGuru updated. You can download the latest version on its `homepage`_.
