# dupeGuru

[dupeGuru][dupeguru] is a cross-platform (Linux, OS X, Windows) GUI tool to find duplicate files in
a system. It's written mostly in Python 3 and has the peculiarity of using
[multiple GUI toolkits][cross-toolkit], all using the same core Python code. On OS X, the UI layer
is written in Objective-C and uses Cocoa. On Linux, it's written in Python and uses Qt5.

The Cocoa UI of dupeGuru is hosted in a separate repo: https://github.com/hsoft/dupeguru-cocoa

## Current status

Development has been slow this past year, however very close to getting all the different 4.0.4 releases posted.  Most of the work this past year (2019) has been towards packaging the application and issues related to that.

Still looking for additional help especially with regards to:
- OSX maintenance (reproducing bugs & cocoa version)
- Linux maintenance (reproducing bugs)

## Contents of this folder

This folder contains the source for dupeGuru. Its documentation is in `help`, but is also
[available online][documentation] in its built form. Here's how this source tree is organized:

* core: Contains the core logic code for dupeGuru. It's Python code.
* qt: UI code for the Qt toolkit. It's written in Python and uses PyQt.
* images: Images used by the different UI codebases.
* pkg: Skeleton files required to create different packages
* help: Help document, written for Sphinx.
* locale: .po files for localization.
* hscommon: A collection of helpers used across HS applications.
* qtlib: A collection of helpers used across Qt UI codebases of HS applications.

## How to build dupeGuru from source

### Windows
For windows instructions see the [Windows Instructions](Windows.md).

### Ubuntu
You'll need venv and Python dev tools to make the project. So ensure you've tried this before starting:

```
$ apt install python3-venv
$ apt install python3-dev
```

### Prerequisites

* [Python 3.5+][python]
* PyQt5

### make

dupeGuru is built with "make":

    $ make
    $ make run

### Generate Debian/Ubuntu package

    $ bash -c "python3 -m venv --system-site-packages env && source env/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt && python3 build.py --clean && python3 package.py"

### Running tests

The complete test suite is run with [Tox 1.7+][tox]. If you have it installed system-wide, you
don't even need to set up a virtualenv. Just `cd` into the root project folder and run `tox`.

If you don't have Tox system-wide, install it in your virtualenv with `pip install tox` and then
run `tox`.

You can also run automated tests without Tox. Extra requirements for running tests are in
`requirements-extra.txt`. So, you can do `pip install -r requirements-extra.txt` inside your
virtualenv and then `py.test core hscommon`
